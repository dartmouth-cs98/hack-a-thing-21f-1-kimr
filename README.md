I built a simple app in which you can add and delete tasks that you need to complete

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

I worked on it on my own.

## What you learned

What I learned is that View is the equivalent to a container. I learned a very primitive structure of keeping state in App.js. I was trying to publish my app, but unfortunately an error kept appearing and I'm not sure how to resolve it
